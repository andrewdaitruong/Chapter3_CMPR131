# Chapter3_CMPR131
# Option 1 (Tic-tac-toe):

-	No animation for presentation
-	We can do graphics
-	Don’t try to mislead (try to be clear for questions)
-	Uml – explain the class implementation & containers
-	ONLY 10 SLIDES
-	Don’t include code in presentation (only display explanations, flowcharts, algorithms)
-	Don’t explain menu, focus on how program works
-	What type of software development did we use to complete project?
Organize documentation (maybe a beginning? I didn’t hear this part)
-	Everyone is responsible for their own submission (should not be different from team members)

Changes:<br>
  - First huge commit: Therese added display for board, with placement code locations for char 'X' or 'O' in Tic-Tac-Toe.<br>
  Base code for human player move coded, with checks for preexisting board placements done (includes quit option).<br><br>
  - Second huge commit (9/19): Danny built out base code for AI moves & win states. Therese merged code and changed check system to use vector for ease
  of AI randomization/checks. Fully expanded to make game work as intended for player vs. AI move (minus smartAI). Added base code for time record of games (needs to be expanded to include # of player moves mapped with it via multimap). Game works as intended minus time prints & number of player wins & smart AI. <br>
  - Third commit (9/20): multimap built out for time + code. display of fastest & slowest games done. menu flow q/a-ed. For most part program is done minus pre/postconditions & smart AI. <br>
  - Fourth commit (9/20): Danny added pre/post-conditions and checked for bugs. Program seems to work as intended. 
<br>
  Therese's Notes:<br>
  - if we want to do smart AI without recursive, might have to hard-code some states for that like we did for win-states. Most optimal way is recursive way (minmax algorithm), but we were also told not to do recursive<br>
